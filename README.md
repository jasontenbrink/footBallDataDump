Node version 8.11.3

running this application will take data from  https://api.ngs.nfl.com/league/schedule
and populate a mongo database

to run the script, from the project root type node src

To Create the database:
install and start up a mongo server
https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#run-mongodb

That should be everything you need to do for the database.  The correct database will be created by mongo once the script is run.
